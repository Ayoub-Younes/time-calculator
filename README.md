# Time Calculation

## Project Overview

The Time Calculation is a Python-based application that allows users to add a specified duration to a given initial time. It takes into account the time format (12-hour clock) and can also determine the resulting day of the week if a starting day is provided. This tool is useful for calculating future times based on a given duration, making it convenient for scheduling and planning purposes.

This project demonstrates time manipulation functionality in Python, focusing on string parsing, arithmetic operations on time, and handling optional input for days of the week.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the time calculation logic.
String Manipulation: Used to parse and format time strings, ensuring the input adheres to the expected format.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: To calculate the resulting time and determine the day of the week after adding the specified duration.
